=======
Today, I learned about flexbox and how to implement it on projects. Also, it was the first time I pushed a project to GitHub and used BEM to structure my CSS. Still, a lot to learn, but the progress is my motivation!


### Continued development

- Flexbox
- Layout
- Research when you get stuck!


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Tutorial - Flexbox containers](https://youtu.be/hwbqquXww-U) - This video series from Kevin Powell, really helped me understand flexbox.
