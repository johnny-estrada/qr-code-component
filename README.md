## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learned to stop when I run into a problems. This reduces the amount of time I wasate trying to figure it out by memory.


### Continued development

- Flexbox
- Layout
- Research when you get stuck!

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://youtu.be/hwbqquXww-U) - This video series from Kevin Powell, really helped me understand flexbox.
