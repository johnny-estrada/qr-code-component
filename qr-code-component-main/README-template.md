## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM Classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learned that I'm not bad at HTML and CSS, and how to use flexbox. When I first started I was just trying to go by memory, but lost a lot a time figuring it out on my own instead of looking it up. 


### Continued development

- Flexbox
- Layout
- Research when you get stuck!

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://youtu.be/hwbqquXww-U) - This video seeries from Kevin Powell, really helped me understand flexbox.
